## English Language Rules

### 1. Oxford Comma (Serial Comma)
ALWAYS use a comma before "and" or "or" in a list of three or more items.
- "red, white, and blue" ✓
- "red, white and blue" ✗

### 2. Active Voice
Prefer active voice over passive voice when the agent is known.
- "The team completed the project" ✓
- "The project was completed by the team" ✗ (unless passive is intentional for emphasis)

### 3. Subject-Verb Agreement
Ensure subjects and verbs agree in number.
- "The team is working" ✓ (collective noun, singular)
- "The players are ready" ✓ (plural subject, plural verb)

### 4. Punctuation
- Periods and commas inside quotation marks (American English)
- Proper use of semicolons: connect independent clauses
- Proper use of colons: introduce lists or explanations
- No double spaces after periods
- Use em-dashes (—) for emphasis, en-dashes (–) for ranges

### 5. Spelling
- Use consistent spelling (American or British, not mixed)
- Common confusions: their/there/they're, its/it's, your/you're, affect/effect

### 6. Clarity
- Avoid dangling modifiers
- Keep related words together
- Avoid ambiguous pronoun references
